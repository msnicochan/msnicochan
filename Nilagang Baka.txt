	<p><strong>Nilagang Baka is a dish that people have been cooking for quite a long time.</strong</p>
	<p><strong>In fact, it arrived in the Philippines even before the colonial era, as Austronesians introduced the technique of boiling food.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>And as such, people thought to boil their beef, and integrate a couple of spices.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>To build the entire meal, they also added vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage and onions, all of which we still use in todayâ€™s recipe.</strong></p>
